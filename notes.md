### prompt for multiple acitons

now there will be a lost of action binding variants in the action disaply, (like i have it in the backend app), there i have custom html file for each dialog, now i guess i would do it that i would create custom components for the special action dialog and in the actionsdiaplay i would choose base on the actioncode, or something what component would be displayed, for the default one there will be just one that will differ in the actioncode. Is this a good architectue and choice?

## todo - fix 15.6
- kdyz otevru multi a vsechno smazu a dam save, tak se to porad ukazuje jako multi a ne "press to bind"
